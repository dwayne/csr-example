# Client-side routing example

A simple demonstration of client-side routing.

## Usage

```bash
devbox shell
caddy run
```

Then, go to `http://localhost:3000` and click around.

## Notes

Try going directly to one of the other pages:

- `http://localhost:3000/about`
- `http://localhost:3000/login`

Do you understand why it loads the `index.html` file and renders a different view?

Think about why you're still able to load `http://localhost:3000/index.js` from the web server.
